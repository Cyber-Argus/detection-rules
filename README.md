# Detection Engineering Rules Repository

**Author:** Cyber-Argus | Cybersecurity Professional  
**Focus:** Detection Engineering | Threat Hunting | Security Operations

## Mission

This repository documents my journey learning detection engineering in public. I'm building detection rules, documenting my methodology, and sharing knowledge as I prepare for a career transition to civilian cybersecurity.

**Current Focus Areas:**
- Sigma detection rules
- YARA malware signatures  
- SIEM-specific queries (Elastic, Sentinel)
- Detection engineering methodology
- MITRE ATT&CK framework mapping

## Status

🚧 **Active Development** - This is a learning repository. Rules are being developed and tested as I build my homelab and study detection engineering.

## Repository Structure

Coming soon - Building folder structure for organized rule development.

## Detection Philosophy

I believe in:
- **Clear documentation** - Every rule should explain *why* it exists
- **MITRE ATT&CK mapping** - Detections tied to adversary behavior
- **False positive awareness** - Understanding the operational impact
- **Learning in public** - Sharing the journey, not just the results

## Progress Tracking

**Started:** December 2024  
**Rules Created:** 0  
**Techniques Covered:** 0
